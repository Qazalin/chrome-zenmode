## Why

You don't use 99% of the UI elements in an app the majority of the time. most of these elements are for navigating to places you don't care about, and almost all apps have some sorta cmd+k that let you just fuzzy find yourself to anywhere.
This chrome extention injects custom js and css to remove the elements that get in the way, while allowing you to seamlessly switch back and forth to see the other features only when you need them.

## Usage

1. Clone
2. Pack the extention
3. cmd+e to toggle zen mode
